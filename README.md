# Machine Learning Restaurant Sales Forecasting System

---

## Overview

This is a project that I am currently planning to complete during my third and final year at University.

It is a full stack Angular & .NET web application powered by a machine learning model to accurately forecast sales for specified day in a local restaurant, taking a varitey of factors from weather, upcoming national holidays, events in the restaurant, events in the local area and expected number of tables into account.  

The secondary function of this application will present the user with a range of visualisations produced through analysing past sales data within the establishment.

I am in the final stages of planning & designing this project. Once I am comfortable with my Angular proficiency, I will begin implementing the application's authentication feature. This repository will be updated accordingly. You can view the current progress of this project in the `Projects` tab, which contains a Kanban Board and Gantt Chart.
