# Machine Learning Restaurant Sales Forecasting System

---

## Overview

This is a project that I am currently planning to complete during my third and final year at University.

It is a full stack Angular & .NET web application powered by regression models to accurately forecast restaurant sales and surface insights to improve inventory & staffing decisions.

The machine learning layer consists of a Python service exposed using Flask, models are trained, tuned, tested, evaluated, and compared using time-aware splits. Historical data is augmented with engineered features for weather, to national holidays, internal events, external events and more.  

The main dashboard presents forecasting capabilities, alongside visualisations of trends, and forecasting history, all presented through a clean & user-friendly interface.

This repository will be updated accordingly. You can view the current progress of this project in the `Projects` tab, containing instances of this project's Kanban Board and Gantt chart.
